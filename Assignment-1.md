1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
* 
'hello'
    -87.8
- 
/ 
+	
6

In the above question values are:
'hello' is a string.
-87.8 is a floating-point variable.
6 is an integer.
Expressions:
/ is a division operator.
+ is a addition operator.
The symbol '-' is an invalid expression .it should require operands on either side to form a valid mathematical expression.

2. What is the difference between string and variable?
Strings are used to represent textual data,while variables are used to store and manipulate different types of data, including strings.

A string is a specific data type whereas variable is a storage location.

Strings are encloced in quotation marks,such as single quotes ('hello') or double quotes ("hello").They can contain letters,numbers,symbols,and spaces.example of strings include names,sentences,and any other text based information.Variables can hold various types of data, including numbers, strings,booleans, and more.

Strings are specific data type used to handle textual information,whereas variables are general-purpose storage locations used to hold and manipulate various types of data, including strings. Variables provide a way to lable and reference values,enhancing and flexibility and functionality of the program.

3. Describe three different data types.

Three different data types that are commonly used in the programming:

Integer(int):
the integer data type represents the whole numbers without any decimal points. it can be both positive and negetive.integers are used to perform arthematic operations,indexing,countingand other tasks that involves whole numbers.
Example of integers include -5,0,and 42.

Flaot(Floating-point number):
The float data type represents numbers with decimal points. is is used to store and manipulate  real numbers. floats are used for calculate the approximate values, such as scientific calculations, financial caculations,and measurements.
Example of float number includes -3.16,0.6 and 2.71828.

String:
The strimng data tyoe represents a sequence of charecters, such as numbers,letters,Symbols,and spaces.strings are used to store and manipulate the textual data.They are commanly used for the names,sentences,messages and any other text based information.Strings are enclosed in a quotation marks, such as 'Hello'or "Hello, world!"
Examples of the string includes "Hello","14567".

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
An expression is a combination of contants,variables,operators and function calls that produces a value.it is as simple as a single variable or constant,or it can be a complex combination of multiple elements.

Expression can made up of various components:
Variables:
Symbols representing values that can change during program execution.
Constants:
Fixed values that cannot change during program execution, such as strings or numbers.
Operators:
These are the symbols are keywords that performs operations on values and variables.Example of operators includes addition(+),subtraction(-),multiplication(*),division(/),and comparision operators.
The purpose of expressions is to perform computation and evaluations.Expression can be used in various contexts,such as assignments,loops,conditional statements.They allow you to manipulate and transform data,make decision based on conditions,or perform calculations required in a program or mathematical equation.

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
Assignment statements:spam=10,x=y+z,etc. 
An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single value. It can be literal value (e.g., 10), a variable (e.g.,spam), or a more complex combination of these elements. Expressions are used to perform calculations or produce a value that can be assigned to a variable or used in other expressions. Examples of expressions include arithmetic operations like addition or multiplication, function calls that return a value,or logical comparisons.

A statement is a complete line of code that performs an action. It is a directive that tells the program to do something. A statement can consist of one or more expressions, variables, keywords, and other programming constructs. Statements are used to control the flow of execution, define behavior, or perform operations. Examples of statements include assignments (e.g., spam = 10), conditionals (e.g., if statements), loops (e.g., for or while loops), or function declarations.

In the specific example you mentioned, spam = 10 is an assignment statement. It assigns the value 10 to the variable named spam. The expression 10 is evaluated, and its value is stored in the variable.

At last,expressions are used to compute or produce values, while statements are used to perform actions, control flow, or define behavior in a program.

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

After running the code bacon = 22; bacon + 1,the variable bacon will still contain the value 22.
bacon = 22: This statement assigns the value 22 to the variable bacon.So,bacon holds the value 22.

bacon + 1: This expression evaluates the sum of the value stored in bacon (which is 22) and 1.this expression doesn't update the value of bacon itself. It simply returns the result of the addition, which is 23. But since the result is not stored in a variable or used further, it doesn't affect the value of bacon.

so, after executing the code, the variable bacon still contains the original value of 22.

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3

The values of the two terms follows as:

'spam' + 'spamspam': This expression performs string concatenation. It combines the string 'spam' with the string 'spamspam'. The result is the string 'spamspamspam'. So, the value of this term is 'spamspamspam'.

'spam' * 3: This expression performs string repetition. It repeats the string 'spam' three times. The result is the string 'spamspamspam'. So, the value of this term is also 'spamspamspam'.

the resulting value is the same for given two terms: 'spamspamspam'.

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

variable names need to follow certain rules and conventions. Here are the reasons why 'eggs' is a valid variable name while '100' is invalid:

Starting character: Variable names typically cannot start with a number. They must start with a letter (uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_). In this case, 'eggs' starts with the letter 'e', which is valid.

Allowed characters: Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. However, they cannot contain spaces or special characters (such as !, @, #, $, etc.) other than underscores. The variable name 'eggs' only contains letters, which is allowed.

Reserved words: Variable names cannot be the same as reserved words or keywords in the programming language. Reserved words have special meanings and are used for specific purposes in the language. '100' is not a valid variable name because it consists solely of numbers, and numbers are not allowed as the first character. Additionally, it could be confused with the numeric literal value 100.

Therefore, 'eggs' is a valid variable name because it follows the rules and conventions for variable naming, while '100' is invalid because it follows the rule of starting with a number and does not conform to the allowed character set for variable names.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

int(): The int() function is used to convert a value into an integer. It can convert a numeric string or a floating-point number to its corresponding integer representation. If the value cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., a string that doesn't represent a valid integer), it will raise a ValueError exception.

float(): The float() function is used to convert a value into a floating-point number. It can convert a numeric string or an integer to its corresponding floating-point representation. If the value cannot be converted to a float (e.g., a string that doesn't represent a valid number), it will raise a ValueError exception.

str(): The str() function is used to convert a value into a string. It can convert any value to its string representation, including integers, floating-point numbers, and other types. It returns a string that represents the value.

Here's an example of the usage of these functions:
value = 22
integer_version = int(value)
float_version = float(value)
string_version = str(value)

print(integer_version)  # Output: 22
print(float_version)  # Output: 22.0
print(string_version)  # Output: '22'

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

The expression 'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.' causes an error because it is trying to concatenate a string ('I have eaten') with an integer (99). In Python, concatenation (+) is only supported between strings. When you attempt to concatenate an integer with a string directly, it results in a type mismatch and raises a TypeError.

To fix this error and perform the concatenation correctly, you need to ensure that all the operands being concatenated are strings. There are a few ways to achieve this:

Convert the integer to a string explicitly:

'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'

Here, str(99) converts the integer 99 to a string, allowing it to be concatenated with the other strings.

Use formatted string literals (f-strings):
f'I have eaten {99} burritos.'
In this case, the integer 99 is placed within curly braces {}, and the f prefix before the string indicates it is an f-string. The value of 99 is automatically converted to a string and inserted into the string during formatting.

Both of these methods will produce the desired result, ensuring that the integer is properly converted to a string before concatenation.
